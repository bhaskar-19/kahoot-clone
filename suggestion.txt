Start by setting up a new Node.js project and initializing it with npm.

Install necessary packages, such as express, mongoose, body-parser, and dotenv.

Create a MongoDB database and configure the connection in your project using Mongoose.

Create a schema for the quizzes and questions using Mongoose.

Create API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting quizzes and questions.

Create routes for the different pages of your website, such as the homepage, quiz page, and results page.

Implement user authentication and authorization to allow users to create and take quizzes.

Add real-time updates to your quiz page using web sockets or a similar technology.

Test your application thoroughly and fix any bugs or issues that arise.

Deploy your application to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS.

Remember that this is just a general overview, and the actual implementation of your kahoot-clone website will depend on your specific requirements and preferences. I recommend breaking down each step into smaller tasks and tackling them one by one to make the process more manageable.

Note that this is just an example of some of the endpoints that you might use for a Kahoot-clone app. The actual endpoints will depend on your specific requirements and implementation.
